# weatherApp
Weather App written with vanilla JS using two different API's to get today's weather and the 5 day forcast!
I connected to two different Api's one with fetch with .then's and the other with fetch and async await.  I also utilized the Date object in JavaScript to help work with the 
days and date manipulation for the app.  I tried to keep the functions as pure as possible without global variables(except grabbing DOM elements) and passing variables as
parameters to other functions and using each functions for a more specific task.  I used one higher order function (forEach) to iterate over an array and I used flex-box in 
my minimal css desing and layout which also helps with different screen sizes.
